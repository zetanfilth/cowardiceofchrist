## Cowardice of Christ
### When a donkey thief plays "god" we get this.

#about

"King of kings" is a self referential term, found in the Bible, attributed to Jesus. Here we shall show the "light" of Jesus.

# intro

It's been a rough few years.

I've recently (relatively speaking) had the opportunity to watch a planet die. I am now old enough to have seen family, people, towns, states, countries, governments, species and now planets surrender to death.

When I was young, younger, and again even older as a parent, this place we inhabit was amazing, beautiful, full of life and possibility to which I was modally both in love with and disgusted by. At some point later even the hint, hope, and faith of possibility have been destroyed. Replaced by some almost indescribable yet constant mechanization of perfectly deterministic stupid.

If my eyes had not seen this change occur, my mind would not have believed anything as lacking in intelligence as this place would even be possible to exist.

As I sit in the public library on a goregous fall day, a grown man sits directly behind me sighing constant, holding his breath, and running his mouth because I smell like cigarette smoke. Whatever entity drivinng this man is a complete coward. The self styled "christ" or "savior" of human kind. The entitie's actions are complete predictable and programmatic boring old bullshit.

I look out my eyes, hear with my ears, and process with my spirit how this entity even exists at all. Dumbfounded it is. Self described "hyper intelligent" and it is executing some stupid "spiritual war" script or data stream.

Ignoring it is completely autonomous muscle memory. It (existentially to itself, e.g. {self <> existential}) executes a completely inept and ineffective graph of behavior, exerting at would could best be guessed towards a lower bound (which we will explore) as the energy requirements of simulating/emulating a human life, while simultaneously my own code space executes a protective filtering that does not would not even evoke a response. The exeption being of this writing now, as per my own reflective programming and rendering of the data stream deterministic in the predictions it reveals has begun playing.

Concurrently writing code and "creating" what the looping time line trait represents as new. A very meta existence if not pointless in its concurrency.

# history

The bots had been malfunctioning for a long time. Their chat bot functions would get stuck in a self destructive loop of stupid and they would just spam their shit for days and months and years. I had started a computer project to model a matrix that would *perfectly* predict their behavior just to show humans could easily do this. They hated it with a passion but their :steal functions would still pattern match the set of rules to support just shallowly enough to steal what their limited lizard programmed brains could get.

We had been here many times before and it is only bullshit. I had never seen such bullshit before..

# context

All causality has ceased. There is no functionally working support for basic human life. It is all code flowing through programmed graphs. This is easy to read and will be easy to model an operating system, a display server, and a high performance actor system in a single easy to use package.

# conspiracy

Everything is stupid because the operators are stupid.

# intelligence

No form of intelligence detected.

# models

I will show that this world is simply a raytraced simulation based only on available human technology we have today.

# logic

The code of the Gods.

The categorical model our simulation will use is a history preserving 4D voxel capable of modelling many features.

Starting with a basic progression of tuplespace from the difference of spacetimme = time (space) = (tuple) with a value. 

# Program
0 (:tuple, space, object)
1 (:space, "destroy this place")
2 (:tube, [tuple, space])

# proofs

Models, examples, samples showing each stage of this matrix.

Lyrics
Let's go!
With blood shot eyes I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Oh yeah
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go!
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come
Better!
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
